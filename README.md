## Acknowledgments
We leveraged documentation from Spotify's Web API to implement many features of our app. We would also like to give a huge thank you to our professor Tim Tregubov and our TA's in CS52 (Full-Stack Web Development) at Dartmouth College for guidance and support, as well as our fellow classmates.
